"""
`rbamlib` is a lightweight, open-source Python library for the analysis and modeling of radiation belts.

The library is architected into Python packages, each acting as a Python module. The packages include functions in
separate Python files. Thus, the function is imported directly from the package without specifying the file name.

Please see README.md for more information.
