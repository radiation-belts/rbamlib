"""
`rbamlib` is a lightweight, open-source Python library for the analysis and modeling of radiation belts.

The library is architected into Python packages, each acting as a Python module. The packages include functions in
separate Python files. Thus, the function is imported directly from the package without specifying the file name.

Please see README.md for more information.

# Importing submodules into the package namespace for easier access.
# This allows users to access submodules directly via `rbamlib.<module_name>`
# without needing to import them separately.
# Example:
# import rbamlib
# rbamlib.utils  # Access
from rbamlib import (
    conv,
    models,
    utils,
    constants
)
